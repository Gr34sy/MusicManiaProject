# Music Mania created with React and LastFM Music API
## The app connects to the LastFM API and enables users to browse music artists and more.
### My goal was to build an app which not only shows some music data but also is a bit intresting. So I've come up with an idea of finding similar artists. This is the core functionality of the app. Users can also add artists to their favourite list which is stored in local storage. It was my first React project and a big experiment. I've tested a lot of React features during the development, for example the react router.
